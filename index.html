    <li><p class="item">Altaf Hussain (Urdu: الطاف حسی) born in 17 September 1953 in Karachi, is a Pakistani politician who is known as the founder of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement.</p></li>
    <li><p class="item">He holds United Kingdom citizenship and has been living in exile in the UK since the start of Operation Clean-up.</p></li>
    <li><p class="item">In 1970, General Yahya Khan introduced the National Service Cadet Scheme (NSCS), making it compulsory for higher secondary scholars to enlist with the army. According to the MQM, Altaf Hussain enlisted with the Pakistan Army through the NSCS and was assigned to the 57th Baloch Regiment as soldier number 2642671. Upon completion of his training his regiment was assigned from Hyderabad to Karachi, from where it was sent to East Pakistan via ships.</p></li>
    <li><p class="item">After the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, Hussain tried to join the regular army but was rejected, allegedly due to his Muhajir background. This experience influenced his future political ambitions. He later participated in a demonstration for the safe return of stranded Pakistanis from Bangladesh, resulting in his arrest and imprisonment for nine months. This event shaped his political journey significantly.</p></li>
    <li><p class="item">Hussain said that while he was admitted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital in 1988, Late Hameed Gul, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief at the time, a sent him a briefcase full of money via Brigadier Imtiaz Ahmed. He said the intention was to bribe him into joining the military establishment-led Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI; Urdu: اسلامی جمہوری اتحاد, lit. 'Islamic Democratic Alliance') coalition which was against the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), but he rejected the offer. Later both Ahmed and Gul confirmed the statement.</p></li>
    <li><p class="item">The MQM's political agenda primarily focuses on advocating for the rights of the Muhajir community in Pakistan. However, Hussain asserts that the party also stands for equality and opportunities for all, regardless of factors such as race, religion, or ethnicity. Originally formed as a movement to empower Muhajirs, the MQM later expanded its ideology to encompass a wider political spectrum, leading to a change in its name from Muhajir Qaumi Movement to Muttahida Qaumi Movement.</p></li>
    <li><p class="item">Hussain married Faiza Gabol in 2001 and divorced in 2007. He has daughter who was born in 2002</p></li>
